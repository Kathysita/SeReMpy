The library is organized within the SeReMpy folder as follow:

- *Data:* this folder contains six datasets used for the examples and the elevation dataset from Yellowstone National Park;
- *RockPhysics:* this library contains functions with several rock physics models;
- *Geostats:* this library contains functions for kriging and geostatistical simulations of random variables;
- *Inversion:* this library contains functions for seismic and rock physics inversion using the analytical and numerical solutions;
- *Facies:* this library contains functions for facies classification and simulation. The SeReMpy package includes multiple scripts with several examples.
