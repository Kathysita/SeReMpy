### Seismic Reservoir Modeling Python package ###


The SeReMpy package includes four libraries and a data folder:

Data: this folder contains six datasets used for the examples and the elevation dataset from Yellowstone National Park;
RockPhysics: this library contains functions with several rock physics models;
Geostats: this library contains functions for kriging and geostatistical simulations of random variables;
Inversion: this library contains functions for seismic and rock physics inversion using the analytical and numerical solutions;
Facies: this library contains functions for facies classification and simulation. The SeReMpy package includes multiple scripts with several examples.
